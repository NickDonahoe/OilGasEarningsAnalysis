operations,  policies or  practices.  Mr.  Rainwater  has  notified the Board of
Directors  of his  intention  not to  stand  for  re-election  to the  Board  of

             SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

       The executive  officers and directors of the Company are required to file
reports  with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  and with the  various
Canadian  provincial  securities   commissions  (the  "Canadian   Commissions"),
disclosing the amount and nature of their beneficial  ownership in common stock,
as well as changes in that ownership.  Pursuant to applicable Canadian policies,
the  executive  officers and  directors of the Company are exempted  from filing
reports  with the  Canadian  Commissions,  provided  that they  timely  file all
reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

       Based  solely on its review of reports and written  representations  that
the Company has received,  the Company  believes that all required  reports were
filed on time for 1999.

ITEM 11.     EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

       The Company began  operations  upon  completion of the merger of Parker &
Parsley and Mesa on August 7, 1997.  Information  about management  compensation
for  periods  before  that  date  refers  to  compensation  that  either  of the
predecessor companies paid.

Compensation of Directors

       Each non-employee  director receives an annual retainer fee of $50,000 if
the director serves on a committee and $40,000 if he does not. In addition, each
non-employee  director is reimbursed for travel  expenses to attend  meetings of
the Board of Directors or its committees  and an additional  $2,500 for services
as chairman of a committee.  No additional fees are paid for attendance at board
or  committee  meetings.  Executive  officers  of the  Company  do  not  receive
additional compensation for serving on the Board of Directors.

       Under the Company's Long-Term  Incentive Plan (the "Plan"),  non-employee
directors  are  eligible to receive  awards in the form of  non-qualified  stock
options, stock appreciation rights,  restricted stock, or performance units. The
Company  uses these  awards  instead of cash to pay its  non-employee  directors
their  annual  retainer  fees.  The Board of Directors  determines  the form (or
combination  of forms) of  consideration  each year,  based on the  economic and
other  circumstances at the time and based on its view of which awards will best
align the interests of the stockholders and the directors.

       In order for the directors to participate in the Company's cost reduction
program  and  to  tie  100%  of  their   compensation  to  the  Company's  stock
performance,  the  Board of  Directors  determined  to use  non-qualified  stock
options  to pay all of the  non-employee  directors'  annual  fees  for the year
following the Company's 1999 annual stockholders'  meeting. The number of shares
subject to stock options granted to each non-employee director was determined by
dividing the  director's  annual  retainer fee by the value of an option for one
share on May 28, 1999 (the last business day of the month in which the Company's
1999 annual  stockholders'  meeting was held).  The options  have a  fair-market
value  exercise  price,  and the value of each option was  calculated  using the
Black-Scholes  method based on assumptions  provided by the Company's  executive

       On May 28, 1999, each non-employee director received the following awards
of stock  options to  compensate  him for his annual  retainer  fee (each  stock
option awarded has an exercise  price of $10.875):  Messrs.  Baroffio,  Gardner,
Jones and Stillwell each received  options for 10,184 shares;  Messrs.  Brumley,
Houghton and Ramsey each received  options for 10,693 shares;  and Mr. Rainwater
received  an option for 8,147  shares.  Mr.  Brumley  subsequently  retired as a
director of the Company  effective  August 31, 1999, and forfeited stock options
to purchase 8,019 shares.

       Effective November 18, 1999 each non-employee  director received an award
of 30,000  non-qualified stock options at an exercise price of $10.25. One third
of these options vest on the day prior to the next annual meeting, May 17, 2000,
one third vest on May 17, 2001 and the  remaining  one third vest May 17,  2002.
The  foregoing  stock  option  awards are not  regular,  annual  awards but were
granted to bring the directors' compensation package to a level competitive with
the director  compensation  of the  Company's  peer group used for  establishing
executive compensation.

       Subject to accelerated lapse in certain  circumstances,  the ownership of
       the stock vests after one year and  transfer  restrictions  lapse on one-
       third of the shares on each of the first,  second and third anniversaries
       of the date of grant. The number of shares of restricted stock awarded as
       annual  bonuses was  calculated  using the last closing sale price of the
       common  stock  before the date of the award  ($22.375).  Ownership of the
       restricted  stock awarded for 1997 vested on September  30, 1998,  due to
       the triggering of a vesting  acceleration  clause  contained in the Plan.
       See Note F. of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in
       "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".

(c)    This  column includes  (i) gross-up payments for taxes in connection with
       the receipt of restricted stock awarded pursuant to the annual bonus plan
       as follows:  Mr. Sheffield $118,805;  Mr. Fagerstone $40,832; Mr. Withrow
       $37,125;  Mr. Dove $37,125;  and  Mr. Smith $34,896;  (ii) relocation and
       housing  cost   of  living   adjustment  related   to  moving   corporate
       headquarters from Midland, Texas to Irving, Texas as follows: payment for
       1998 - Mr. Withrow $42,290;  payments for 1997 - Mr. Sheffield  $432,856;
       Mr. Withrow $204,000; and Mr. Dove $290,737;  (iii) tax gross-up payments
       for  relocation and  cost of  living  adjustment:  payment for 1998 - Mr.
       Withrow $12,044;  payments for 1997 - Mr. Sheffield $283,781; Mr. Withrow
       $133,742;  and  Mr.  Dove  $190,458;  (iv)  and  a  1997  payment  to Mr.
       Fagerstone  of  $21,153.    Amounts  not  shown  represent  miscellaneous
       perquisites.

(d)    The restricted stock awarded in 1997 represents grants on August 8,  1997
       of 59,000 shares  of common stock to  Mr. Sheffield  and 23,000 shares of
       common stock to each of Messrs. Fagerstone, Withrow,  Dove and Smith with
       vesting restrictions that were to lapse one-half on  August 8, 2000,  and
       one-half on August 8, 2001.  Messrs. Sheffield, Fagerstone, Withrow, Dove
       and Smith's  restricted stock  fully vested on September 30,  1998 due to
       the triggering  of a vesting  acceleration  clause contained in the Plan.
       See Note F. of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in
       "Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". The values of the
       awards were  calculated using the closing  sale price of the common stock
       of $37.875 on  August 7, 1997.   Because all vesting  restrictions on all
       restricted stock heretofore awarded to each executive officer have lapsed
       (either  by their  terms or through  acceleration  upon the  happening of
       certain events)  no executive officer held any shares of restricted stock
       on December 31, 1999.

(e)    For 1999 this column includes (i)  contributions to qualified  retirement
       plans  for  Messrs.  Sheffield,  Fagerstone,  Withrow,  Dove and Smith of
       $16,000,  $15,814,  $15,922,   $15,894,   $15,922,   respectively;   (ii)
       contributions  to  the  Company's   non-qualified  deferred  compensation
       retirement plan form Messrs.  Sheffield,  Fagerstone,  Withrow,  Dove and
       Smith of $48,923, $24,750, $22,933, $22,500, $22,933, respectively; (iii)
       a $1,330  premium  with respect to a term life  insurance  policy for the
       benefit of Mr. Sheffield;  (iv)  reimbursement  for financial  counseling
       services   for  Messrs.   Sheffield   and  Smith  for  $3,125  and  $507,
       respectively.

       Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for employee and non-employee
director  awards  in the  form of  stock  options,  stock  appreciation  rights,
restricted  stock,  and performance  units payable in stock or cash. The maximum
number of shares of common  stock that may be issued  under the Plan is equal to
10% of the total number of shares of common stock  outstanding from time to time
minus the total number of shares of stock subject to  outstanding  awards on the
date of calculation  under any other stock-based plan for employees or directors
of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Plan had 4,275,311 shares available for
additional awards at December 31, 1999.

       Information  about  restricted  stock  awards  made under the Plan is set
forth  in  the  Summary  Compensation  Table.  No  performance  units  or  stock
appreciation rights have been awarded under the Plan.

       one-third  each year  commencing  on the first  anniversary  of the grant
       date,  and  have a term of five  years  from  the  date of  vesting.  The

(b)    These  options  were  granted  on August  23,  1999,  vest at the rate of
       one-third  each year  commencing  on the first  anniversary  of the grant
       date,  and  have a term of five  years  from  the  date of  vesting.  The
       Compensation  Committee  retains  discretion,  subject to plan limits, to
       modify the terms of the  options.  In the event of a change in control of
       the Company as defined in the Plan, the options will  immediately  become
       fully vested and exercisable in full.

(c)    The exercise  price per share is equal to the closing price of the common
       stock on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape on the day before the
       date of grant.

(d)    The  estimated  grant  date value of shares in  footnotes  (a) and (b) is
       determined using the  Black-Scholes  model. The material  assumptions and
       adjustments  incorporated  in the  Black-Scholes  model in estimating the
       value of the options include the following:

       o   An interest  rate of 6.59% for  footnote  (a) and 6.51% for  footnote
           (b), which represents the interest rate on a U. S. Treasury  security
           with a maturity date corresponding to the option term.

       o   Volatility  of  50%  for  footnote  (a)  and  50%  for  footnote  (b)
           calculated using  daily stock  prices for the 120-day period prior to
           the grant date.

           No other  adjustments were made to the model for  non-transferability
           or risk of forfeiture. The ultimate values of the options will depend
           on the future  market  price of the  common  stock,  which  cannot be
           forecast  with  reasonable  accuracy.  The actual  value,  if any, an
           optionee  will realize upon  exercise of an option will depend on the
           excess of the  market  value of the common  stock  over the  exercise
           price on the date the option is exercised.

       The  following  table  sets  forth,  for each  named  executive  officer,
information  concerning  the exercise of stock options during 1999 and the value
of unexercised stock options as of December 31, 1999.

(a)    Amounts were calculated by multiplying the number of unexercised  options
       by  $8.9375,  which was the  closing  sale price of the  common  stock on
       December 31, 1999 and subtracting the aggregate exercise price.

       Retirement   Plan.  The  Company   provides  a   non-qualified   deferred
compensation retirement plan for officers and key employees of the Company. Each
participant  is allowed to  contribute  up to 25% of base  salary.  The  Company
provides  a  matching  contribution  of 100% of the  participant's  contribution
limited to the first 10% of the  officer's  base  salary.  The Company  matching
contribution vests immediately.

       Employee  Investment  Partnerships.  From  1987  through  1991,  Parker &
Parsley   formed   employee   partnership   programs  in  which  Mr.   Sheffield
participated.  In 1992 and 1993 Mr. Sheffield and Mr. Withrow  participated in a
Direct Investment  Partnership formed to invest in all wells drilled by Parker &
Parsley  during  those  years  (except  in  certain   circumstances   where  its
participation would impose additional costs to Parker & Parsley). As of December
31,  1999,  the  aggregate  contributions  that have  been made to the  employee
partnerships  and the Direct  Investment  Partnerships by Mr.  Sheffield and Mr.
Withrow and the  aggregate  distributions  that have been  received by them from
those  partnerships  were as follows:  Mr.  Sheffield  contributed  $734,955 and
received $1,145,680 ($79,555 of which was received during 1999); and Mr. Withrow
contributed $142,625 and received $151,437 ($13,206 of which was received during
1999).

       Severance  Agreements.  On August  8,  1997,  the  Company  entered  into
severance  agreements  with its  officers.  Salaries  and bonuses are set by the
Compensation  Committee  independent of these  agreements,  and the Compensation
Committee can increase or reduce base salaries at its discretion.

       Either the Company or the officer may terminate the officer's  employment
under the severance  agreement at any time.  The Company must pay the officer an
amount equal to one year's base salary if the officer's employment is terminated
because of death,  disability,  or normal  retirement.  The Company must pay the

                                        8


<PAGE>


officer an amount equal to one year's base salary and continue health  insurance
for the officer's  family for one year if the Company  terminates  the officer's
employment  without  cause  or if the  officer  terminates  employment  for good
reason,  which is when  reductions  in the  officer's  base annual salary exceed
specified limits or when the officer's  responsibilities have been significantly
reduced.  If within  one year  after a change in  control  of the  Company,  the
Company  terminates  the officer  without  cause,  or if the officer  terminates
employment for good reason,  the Company must pay the officer an amount equal to
2.99 times the sum of the  officer's  base salary plus target bonus for the year
and continue  health  insurance  for the  officer's  family for one year. If the
officer terminates employment with the Company without reason between six months
and one year after a change in  control,  or at any time within one year after a
change in control if the officer is required to move,  then the Company must pay
the  officer  one year's  base  salary and  continue  health  insurance  for the
officer's family for one year. Officers are also entitled to additional payments
for certain tax  liabilities  that may apply to severance  payments  following a
change in control.

        Indemnification Agreements. The Company has entered into indemnification
agreements  with  each  of its  directors  and  officers,  including  the  named
executive  officers.  Those  agreements  require  the Company to  indemnify  the
directors and officers to the fullest extent  permitted by the Delaware  General
Corporation  Law and to advance  expenses  in  connection  with  certain  claims
against  directors  and  officers.  The  Company  expects to enter into  similar
agreements  with persons  selected to be  directors  and officers in the future.
Each  indemnification  agreement also provides that, upon a potential  change in
control of the Company and if the  indemnified  director or officer so requests,
the Company will create a trust for the benefit of the  indemnified  director or
officer in an amount  sufficient to satisfy payment of all liabilities and suits
against which the Company has indemnified the director or officer.

           COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

       Mr. Robert L. Stillwell  is a member of the Compensation Committee and is
a partner of Baker & Botts, L.L.P., which provided limited legal services to the
Company  during 1999. The dollar amount of fees that the Company paid to Baker &
Botts,  L.L.P.,  during  the most  recent  fiscal  year of that law firm did not
exceed 5% of that firm's gross  revenues.  Mr.  Stillwell  does not serve on the
sub-committee  of the  Compensation  Committee  which  administers the Company's
Long-Term Incentive Plan.

ITEM 13.     CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

       The  Company,  through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  has in the past
sponsored certain  affiliated  partnerships,  including 22 public and 22 private
drilling  partnerships and three public income  partnerships,  all of which were
formed  primarily for the purpose of drilling and completing  wells or acquiring
producing properties. In accordance with the terms of the partnership agreements
and the related tax partnership  agreements of the affiliated partnerships,  the

                                       10


<PAGE>



Company  participated  in the  activities  of the  sponsored  partnerships  on a
promoted basis. In 1992, the Company discontinued  sponsoring public and private
oil and gas development drilling and income partnerships.

       During  each of  1994,  1993  and  1992,  the  Company  formed  a  Direct
Investment  Partnership for the purpose of permitting  selected key employees to
invest directly,  on an unpromoted basis, in wells that the Company drills.  The
partners in the Direct Investment Partnerships formed in 1994, 1993 and 1992 pay
and receive approximately .337%, 1.5375% and 1.865%, respectively,  of the costs
and revenues  attributable to the Company's  interest in the wells in which each
such Direct Investment  Partnership  participates.  The Company discontinued the
formation of Direct Investment Partnerships in 1995.

       The Company,  through a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  serves as operator of
properties  in  which  it and its  affiliated  partnerships  have  an  interest.
Accordingly,  the  Company  receives  producing  well  overhead,  drilling  well
overhead  and  other  fees  related  to the  operation  of the  properties.  The
affiliated  partnerships also reimburse the Company for their allocated share of
general and administrative charges.

       Effective  January 1, 1999,  the Company  entered into an agreement  with
Rainwater,  Inc., the former general  partner of DNR that Mr.  Rainwater  wholly
owns,  modifying  certain terms of a prior agreement between DNR and Mesa, which
was assumed by the Company  upon  consummation  of the merger  between  Parker &
Parsley and Mesa.  Pursuant to the terms of this  agreement,  as  modified,  the
Company will pay Rainwater, Inc. $300,000 per year and reimburse Rainwater, Inc.
for certain expenses in consideration of the provision of certain consulting and
financial  analysis  services  to  the  Company  by  Rainwater,   Inc.  and  its
representatives.

       On June 29, 1999, the Company completed the sale of certain United States
oil and gas producing properties,  gas plants and other assets primarily located
in the Gulf  Coast,  Mid  Continent  and  Permian  Basin to Prize  Energy  Corp.
("Prize"). The sale of these assets was initiated through an auction process.

       The Board of Directors of Prize includes  Mr. Philip P. Smith,  its Chief
Executive Officer,  Mr. Kenneth A. Hersh, and Mr. Lon C. Kile, its President and
Chief Operating  Officer.  Mr. Hersh,  through his association  with Natural Gas
Partners V, L.P., owned or controlled  approximately 88% of Prize. Messrs. Smith
and Kile owned or controlled  approximately 10.5% and .5% of Prize respectively.
Because Mr.  Smith and Mr.  Hersh were  members of the Board of Directors of the
Company and Mr. Kile was an Executive  Vice  President  of the Company  prior to
initiating the auction process, supervision of the sale process was placed under
the direction of a special independent committee (comprised of outside directors
unrelated  to  Prize)  of the  Company's  Board of  Directors.  The  independent
committee  reviewed and considered  all offers  presented to the Company for the
purchase of the assets  acquired by Prize.  The Prize offer was  approved by the
special  independent  committee  as being the best  offer  presented.  Following
approval of the Prize offer by the special independent committee, Messrs. Smith,
Hersh and Kile resigned their positions with the Company.

       In accordance  with the terms of the Prize  purchase and sale  agreement,
the Company  received net sales proceeds of $245.0 million,  comprised of $215.0
million of cash and 2,307.693 shares of six percent convertible  preferred stock
having a liquidation  preference and fair value of $30.0 million. As a result of
Prize merging with Vista Energy  Resources,  Inc.,  the Company's  investment in
Prize's six percent  convertible  preferred  stock was  exchanged  for 4,018,161
shares  of  Prize  Series  A  convertible   preferred  stock  ("Prize  Series  A
Preferred").  The Prize  Series A  Preferred  provides  for six  percent  annual
dividend  payments,  payable  quarterly  in  additional  equity  shares of Prize
through 2001.  Subsequent to 2001,  Prize has the option of paying the quarterly
dividends on the Prize Series A Preferred in equity  shares or cash.  Each share
of the Prize Series A Preferred may, at the option of the Company,  be converted
into  one  share  of  Prize  common  stock,  subject  to  certain  anti-dilution
adjustments.

       The Company has entered into an agreement with Prize,  subject to certain
contingencies,  to sell effective March 31, 2000,  1,380,446 shares of the Prize
Series A Preferred  back to Prize for  $18,636,021.  Pioneer and Prize have also
agreed to  convert the  remaining  shares of the  Prize  Series A  Preferred  to
2,637,715  shares of Prize common  stock.  If these  transactions are  completed
as planned, the Company's  ownership of  outstanding Prize common and  preferred
voting  shares  would  decline  from 27.4% to  19.9% and  Mr.  Sheffield and Mr.
Withrow will resign from the Prize Board of Directors.

                                       11

       In February  1999,  the Company,  after  approval  from the  Compensation
Committee,  forgave an August,  1997 loan to Mr. Dove in the amount of $113,204,
which funded the tax liability resulting from vesting of his restricted stock in
August 1997 in the merger of Parker & Parsley and MESA.
