By default, tag name, tag labels,\\r\\n                    and tagged content are included in Search. To search tagged\\r\\n                    information, enter a keyword and select the magnifying glass\\r\\n                    icon to return matching results. Tagged facts matching the\\r\\n                    search criteria are shown with a yellow-colored (default)\\r\\n                    shading, while Tagged Sections are reduced to just those\\r\\n                    that included the entered search keywords (if expanded; see\\r\\n                    Tagged Sections for additional detail). The content included\\r\\n                    in Search can be increased to included tag definitions,\\r\\n                    dimensions, and authoritative references. See Settings for\\r\\n                    more information.\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    Search operators “and” (via “AND” or\\r\\n                    “&”) and “or” (via “OR”\\r\\n                    or “|”) are available to further refine a\\r\\n                    search. For example, and with Settings “Include\\r\\n                    References” on, searching for “FASB AND\\r\\n                    225” will highlight tagged data that is related to\\r\\n                    FASB Codification topic 225.\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    Filters can be used in conjunction with Search to\\r\\n                    further refine the scope of Search. Filters reduce the\\r\\n                    amount of tagged facts that the keyword search is performed\\r\\n                    on. For example, if “cash” is entered in conjunction with a\\r\\n                    Tags filter of “Custom Only”, the shaded search\\r\\n                    results will only be indicated on tagged facts based on a\\r\\n                    custom tag.\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                \\r\\n              \\r\\n            \\r\\n            \\r\\n              \\r\\n                 Filter\\r\\n                \\r\\n              \\r\\n              \\r\\n                \\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    Filters change the number of highlighted facts\\r\\n                    indicated by providing several ways to review the tagged\\r\\n                    information. Multiple filters can be used at once. When the\\r\\n                    first filter is applied, a filter toolbar indicates all\\r\\n                    active filter selections and provides the ability to remove\\r\\n                    one or all applied filters.\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                  Data\\r\\n                    Filter\\r\\n                  These filters options allow the user to refine the highlighted\\r\\n                  tagged facts by data type:\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    All - Displays all tagged data (default)\\r\\n                    Amounts Only - Numeric items only\\r\\n                    Text Only - Textual items only\\r\\n                    Calculations Only - Numeric items\\r\\n                      participating in a calculation\\r\\n                    Negatives Only - Numeric items with the\\r\\n                      Inline “sign” option\\r\\n                    Additional Items Only - Tagged items\\r\\n                      with potentially no corresponding HTML presentation (i.e.,\\r\\n                      hidden)\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                  Tags\\r\\n                    Filter\\r\\n                  These filters allow the user to refine the highlighted facts\\r\\n                  by tag type:\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    Standard Only - Tags from a common\\r\\n                      taxonomy (e.g., US_GAAP, DEI)\\r\\n                    Custom Only - Extension tags unique to\\r\\n                      the entity\\'s document\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                  More\\r\\n                    Filters\\r\\n                  Additional filters that allow user to further refine the\\r\\n                  highlighted facts:\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    Periods - List of all used context\\r\\n                      reporting periods\\r\\n                    Measures - List of all used units of\\r\\n                      measure; as applicable\\r\\n                    Axes - List of all used axes\\r\\n                      (dimensions); as applicable\\r\\n                    Scale - List of all used scaled options\\r\\n                      (e.g., thousands, millions); as applicable\\r\\n                    Balance - Debit, credit; as applicable\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    Multiple filters work in conjunction with each other. For\\r\\n                    example, selecting the \"Amounts Only\" Data filter and\\r\\n                    \"Custom Only\" Tags filter will highlight only numeric tagged\\r\\n                    facts using custom tags. Active filters are displayed in the\\r\\n                    Filter toolbar as they are selected. Active filters can be\\r\\n                    removed individually by selecting the \"X\" icon to the\\r\\n                    right of each filter, or all at once via the \"Clear All\"\\r\\n                    option.\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                \\r\\n              \\r\\n            \\r\\n            \\r\\n              \\r\\n                \\r\\n                  Facts Results List \\r\\n              \\r\\n              \\r\\n                \\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    Selecting the down arrow \"V\" to the right of the\\r\\n                    facts count on the toolbar reveals the Facts Results\\r\\n                      List; a navigable listing of all currently highlighted\\r\\n                    tagged facts. By default, all tagged facts are displayed in\\r\\n                    the Facts Results List. The list content and count\\r\\n                    reflects the currently highlighted facts (i.e., both Filters\\r\\n                    and Search criteria refine the list to match the\\r\\n                    highlighted tagged facts). Navigation controls are available\\r\\n                    to move through the list as well as move the current view to\\r\\n                    the corresponding highlighted fact location automatically.\\r\\n                    When a fact in the Facts Results List is selected, it\\r\\n                    will reveal the Fact Review Window.  If\\r\\n                    the letter \"A\" appears for a fact, it indicates the\\r\\n                    fact is additional data (i.e., hidden with potentially no\\r\\n                    corresponding HTML presentation). If the letter \"C\"\\r\\n                    appears, the fact is tagged with a custom tag. If the letter\\r\\n                    \"D\" appears, the fact is tagged with dimensional\\r\\n                    information.\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                \\r\\n              \\r\\n            \\r\\n            \\r\\n              \\r\\n                \\r\\n                  Information \\r\\n              \\r\\n              \\r\\n                \\r\\n                  The Information menu item provides additional detail\\r\\n                  about the current Inline document and customizable viewer\\r\\n                  settings.\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    Document - Basic company and document\\r\\n                      information\\r\\n                    Tags - Fact and tag (standard and\\r\\n                      custom) information\\r\\n                    Files - Files used\\r\\n                    Additional Items - Additional data\\r\\n                      that\\'s been tagged but potentially does not have a\\r\\n                      corresponding location in the HTML\\r\\n                  \\r\\n                \\r\\n              \\r\\n            \\r\\n            \\r\\n              \\r\\n                \\r\\n                  Tagged Sections \\r\\n              \\r\\n              \\r\\n                \\r\\n                  \\r\\n                    The Tagged Sections toolbar/menu item provides a\\r\\n                    listing of the tagged sections of the Inline document.
